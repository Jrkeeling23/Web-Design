        <p style="color:rebeccapurple;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 16pt;">As seen in earlier tutorials, style can also be applied to font color and size. It can also have multiple styles by separating them with a semi-colon.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Text can be aligned with styles as well.</p>
