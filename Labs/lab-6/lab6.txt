KEY IDEAS OF WEBSITE COMPOSITION

Find your focus: Burger king website... big burger in the middle.

Direct your eyes with leading lines: Think of img of train.

Scale abd Heirarchy: Easy to read. Heirarchies are well thought out and easy to read/access. The size of images and font aid.

Balance out your Elements: One image can span across... 3 smaller images can be placed elsewhere across the width as well. Colors.

Use Elements that compliment each other:

Boost or Reduce your Contrast: White with tranparent grey over image = Depth of Contrast: Match the vibe.

Dont forget White Space: Keep simple and not too much 

Align Elements: ELements are appealing to look at due to alignment

Divide your Design into thirds: Literally cut into thirds

Grids: Keep size and spacing consitent

Interesting Grids: Do not be boring

Clothesline Method:
